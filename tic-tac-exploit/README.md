### Tic-Tac-Exploit

Since you came here you're probably looking for clues to cheat!
Or you're just wondering how this works

The table is represented with nine bits and it's laid down like this
|   0	|   1	|   2	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|   3	|   4	|   5	|
|   6	|   7	|   8	|

Then clicking any of these boxes will automatically create an issue about changing the contents of that cell
However We're going to fill every other box with X's, so the player will lose...

### Github Automation
The github workflow will read the title in the issue, and then modify the readme files accordingly
